                The Random Art Generator is a program that algorithmically develops a randomized piece of modern art. Generally speaking, it is created
                byd eveloping mini-squares within the square-shaped artwork, and fills them with different random shapes of different colours and transparencies.
                They are then connected together in a visual array placed on a single image to create the final artpiece.<br><br>

                <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python and Tkinter
