            On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdmpHnj8ZbI2DKzfO3bsAhA" title="Pamanci - YouTube">Pamanci,</a> I've made varying YouTube videos on North America soccer. These primarily include historical videos, such as
            my series on South Floridan Soccer History. This series included 10 videos from the Miami Gatos of the 1970s to the creation of Inter Miami in 2018.
            I have also covered numerous videos on local Canadian soccer, from the now defunct K-W United of the PDL to Toronto FC of Major League Soccer.
