        <p>Hello! My name is Isaiah Sinclair and I'm a second year CS student at University of Guelph!<br>
        Aside from software, I have a deep passion in economics, soccer, politics and mathematics. I'm currently minoring in Business Economics as a result.<br>
        I currently <strong>know C, Java and Python.</strong> I'm currently in the process of learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript.<br><br>
        Presently, I work a summer job at Westrock as a Production Worker, and have previously worked at the Kitchener Market for G&G Family Produce.<br>
        I have also written for Waking the Red as a writer about Toronto FC in my free time, and have a YouTube channel named 'Pamanci' which is also about North American Soccer.<br><br>
        For more info on any of things I've listed, click the links above.</p>
